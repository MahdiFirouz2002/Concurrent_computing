**Concurrent Computing Repository**

Welcome to the Concurrent Computing Repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring various concepts and implementations of concurrent computing. Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast, this repository aims to provide valuable resources, projects, and insights into concurrent programming paradigms.

### Projects

1. **Workers Project**
   - Description: In this project, we simulate a group of workers who have specific work hours and lunch breaks. All tasks assigned to these workers are handled using multithreading to achieve concurrent execution.
   - Technologies: Python, Multithreading

2. **Tour de France Simulation**
   - Description: This project simulates the famous cycling event, Tour de France, where multiple cyclists compete in stages. The simulation is designed to run concurrently, with each cyclist being handled by a separate process.
   - Technologies: Python, Multiprocessing

### Usage

1. **Workers Project**
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
   - Navigate to the directory containing `workers.py`.
   - Run `python workers.py` to execute the project.
   - Follow on-screen instructions to observe the workers' behavior during work hours and lunch breaks.
